License Plate Detection
================

## Install

`pip install license_plate_detection`

## How to use

### Download the dataset

Download the dataset from https://github.com/detectRecog/CCPD and put
all of that into a directory. There is a ./exp/license_ds.csv file
contains only samples of ccpd_base directory (there are few other of
ccpd\_\* for other weather conditions) which is for faster data loading
in fastai. For simplicity, I only used ccpd_base.

### Experimenting

- There is a notebook named /exps/faster_rcnn.ipynb that illustrates a
  whole training neural workflow from loading dataset to inference

### TODO

- Model havenâ€™t been well trained, there must be some wrong
  implemtations
- Improve NMS operation, the current stage of region refinement of RPN
  is lack of NMS because the pure NMS is slow which may affects the
  speed of training
- Add OCR feature for detecting the license plate number of each
  predictions
- Add RPN config for easier customization
